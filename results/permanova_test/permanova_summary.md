- **Number of Samples:** 237
- **Number of Taxa:** 99

## Results Table

| Variable | R² | p-value | Significant | n_samples |
|----------|-----|---------|-------------|----------|
| Timing | 0.016 | 0.002 | Yes | 237 |
| Severity | 0.024 | 0.008 | Yes | 237 |
| Symptoms | 0.012 | 0.068 | No | 237 |

## Interpretation

Significant associations were found for 2 variables: Timing, Severity.
This indicates that these factors are associated with differences in the microbiome composition.

### Effect Sizes (R²)
The R² value represents the proportion of variation in community structure explained by each variable:
- **Timing**: R² = 0.016 (small effect size, explains 1.6% of variation)
- **Severity**: R² = 0.024 (small effect size, explains 2.4% of variation)
